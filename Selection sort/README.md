This project demonstrate realisation of selection sort algorithm

Consider sorting n numbers stored in array A by first finding the smallest element
of A and exchanging it with the element in A[1]. Then find the second smallest
element of A, and exchange it with A[2]. Continue in this manner for the first n - 1
elements of A. Write pseudocode for this algorithm, which is known as selection
sort 

Unsorted array = 2 7 23 12 89 5 8 11 
Array after selection sort = 2 5 7 8 11 12 23 89
